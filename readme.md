# ECG-HRV Data Processing Pipeline

## Notes

Parameters.segmentation.duration: mention that the duration needs to make sense (i.e., there will not be a check whether the duration of event_onset_e1 includes the onset of event_e2, for example).

ECG data and event date need to have timestamp in relative time (i.e., milliseconds starting at 0)
